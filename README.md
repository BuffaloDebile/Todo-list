<h1>Just a todo list to learn javascript</h1>

<h2>This todolist is the first exercise of Dev Ed's Javasript course and my first approach to Javascript</h2>

<h3>This first Github repository is a serie of many others that will be published in order to keep track of Javascript progress and practice the basics of git & Github by pushing all projects to a new repository</h3>

<p>My feelings: <br>
Javascript seem very hard, Im quite confused and not yet ready to complete even a simple js project on my own. Howeverver I start to get familiar with snipets and understand what I am reading in js. I guess that's a sign of progress and I need to learning.
